# Finite Element Analysis of double fixed-end beam
This is a repository for a FEA script used to highlight the differences between different types 
of two-node elements in the analysis of a double fixed-end beam under beding due to a shear load applied to its geometric center.
Three types of FEA elements are used:
* Euler
* Shear Full
* Shear Reduced

The problem of shear locking and the conditions under which it develops are also illustated.
